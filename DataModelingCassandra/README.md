# Data Modeling with Cassandra Project 2
# Creating a Cassandra Database for Sparkify
### Data Engineer: Matthew Prout

<br/>

## Project Overview
The Sparkify company would like to be able to gather insights from data they have on songs that users listen to.  They would like to create an ETL pipeline to ingest the files into a Cassandra database, and also create queries for this database.


## Raw Data
The user data are CSV files stored in the `event_data` folder.


## Running the code
The ETL pipeline and queries can be run from the `Project_1B_ Project_Template.ipynb` notebook.


## Files:
| File | Purpose |
| - | - |
| `Project_1B_ Project_Template.ipynb` | The notebook that runs the ETL pipeline to create the Cassandra database, and also run queries against it.|
| `event_datafile_new.csv` | A denormalized user data file. |
